📘 Final Report – Data Science Internship

🔎 Summary

During this internship, I worked on two practical data science projects using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

The goal was to gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building machine learning models.

✅ Completed Tasks

📂 Task 1: Bank Marketing Analysis

Objective: Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

Dataset: Bank marketing data from a financial institution.

Key Steps:

Cleaned and prepared the dataset.

Encoded categorical variables.

Performed EDA to explore customer behavior.

Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Insights:

Contact method and call duration were strong indicators of customer response.

Account balance and previous campaign results also played significant roles.

📂 Task 2: NBA Player Performance Prediction (Regression)

Objective: Estimate NBA player performance based on various statistics.

Dataset: NBA player stats, including points, assists, rebounds, etc.

Key Steps:

Conducted EDA and visualized statistical relationships.

Engineered new features and normalized the dataset.

Selected impactful features using correlation analysis and model importance.

Trained regression models (Linear Regression and Ridge Regression).

Evaluated model performance using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Key Insights:

Points per game, minutes played, and overall efficiency were top performance indicators.

Ridge Regression slightly outperformed Linear Regression by reducing overfitting.
